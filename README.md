## CONFIGURATIONS
* JDK v16.0.2 
* Selenium v4.0.0
* Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers v4.9.0

## PROBLEM DETAILS
The problem statement specified us to draw some basic shapes (lines and rectangles) and erase one of the lines on http://www.htmlcanvasstudio.com/ using an Automation tool.

## APPROACH
The solution proposed includes a Selenium Script which uses a modular approach by separating the drawing actions and their action calls. The elements were identified using the findElement method and the Actions class within Selenium  was used for performing the click, drag and release operations.
